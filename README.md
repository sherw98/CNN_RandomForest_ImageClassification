# ImageClassification
Image Classification Using Machine Learning Techniques

The goal of this project is to classify natural scenes image data, which is made available by Intel for an image classification challenge.

Our data are obtained from the Intel Image Classification dataset, which was originally an online image classification challenge initiated by Intel. The data are available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification).
